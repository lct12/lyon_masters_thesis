My master's dissertation from Université Lumière Lyon, entitled "The Dual Role of Political Identity and Nationality in Cooperation." It received a score of 17/20, which is considered "exceptional performance" and is the equivalent of an A in the US or a Distinction (73-74) in the UK.

## Abstract
Although several studies have investigated the role of social identity in economics, few have examined how multiple facets of identity reinforce, or alternatively, under- mine, in-group biases and out-group discrimination. This study contributes to the sparse literature on this question by investigating whether sharing a common Ameri- can nationality can overcome partisan discrimination against members of the political out-group. I randomize 57 American participants into one of two treatment arms: a priming treatment that attempts to increase the salience of their national identity by asking them to reflect upon their country and its culture, and a baseline treatment inquiring about their favorite TV shows that serves as a control. After the treatment, all participants play a standard stag hunt game against six hypothetical opponents: two American, two Brits, and two Frenchmen/women, each of whom is identified as either a Republican or Democrat. The participants are then paired off and awarded points based on their actual choices in the study. I find that my participants frequently demonstrate a strong preference for their co-partisans, regardless of nationality; the priming treatment does not appear to affect this pattern. I also observe that partisan discrimination seems to be driven mostly by statistical discrimination rather than a distaste for members of the opposite party, although the latter plays a small role as well.

The other files are the code used in the dissertation. 
1. `main.R` is the main script, from which all other scripts can be run.
2. `import_clean_data.R` is the script that imports and cleans the data.
3. `summary.R` creates summary statistics and graphs.
4. `regressions.R` runs the regressions used in the study.
5. `points.R` calculates the number of points that each individual received (individuals received points to encourage them to "win" their games, and each point = one entry into a lottery that I ran with gift card prizes)
